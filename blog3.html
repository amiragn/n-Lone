                    <p> Depression is the most common mental disorder. If depression occurs, there are several ways to overcome it by changing your lifestyle and behavior.
                        Depression can affect how you feel and how you think and behave. If this feeling lasts for days or weeks, of course it will interfere with work or daily activities.
                        Symptoms of depression must be addressed immediately so that it does not last long. To overcome this, you can consult a psychiatrist and make lifestyle and behavior changes. Here are some ways to get rid of depression of the mind:                 
                      <br><br><span>- Exercising</span><br>
                      Overcoming depression can be done by doing sports that can help improve mood. Regular exercise can make you feel better. The benefits of this exercise have long-lasting effects because it encourages the brain to think positively.
                      <br><br><span>- Think Positive</span><br>
                      The way to deal with depression can also be to prevent every negative thought that comes by using logic. This will help to tolerate and overcome the behavior to be more positive and healthy.
                      <br><br><span>- Looking for friends to talk to</span><br>
                      If you are feeling down, don't be alone. You can share stories with trusted family or close friends. Express all the problems that occur so that sharing feelings can make the heart more relieved.
                      <br><br><span>- Slowly Solve Problems</span><br>
                      Serious problems that cause depression must be resolved gradually. Solving one by one can control emotions and can make depression slowly go away.
                      <br><br><span>- Regulate Your Food Intake</span><br>
                      Food can help reduce depression levels. Foods that are high in selenium and magnesium are great for treating depression. These types of foods such as nuts, wheat, tuna, chocolate, and shellfish.
                      <br><br><span>- Have a Diary</span><br>
                      Keeping a diary can keep negative events from feeling natural. Writing down all the feelings every day through a diary can be used as a reminder when you are going through a difficult time, you can feel that there are other positive things that have been experienced.
                      <br><br><span>- Sleep Enough</span><br>
                      Lack of sleep can worsen depression, which can make you feel even worse. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Get rid of all the things that disturb your sleep such as computers, TVs, and cellphones if your bedtime schedule has arrived.
                      <br><br><span>- Doing New Things</span><br>
                      Doing something new when you start to feel depressed can prevent depression. Doing new things will challenge you and increase the hormone dopamine which is associated with feelings of pleasure or enjoyment.
                      <br><br><span>- Go Outdoors</span><br>
                      A depressed mind will make you want to lock yourself up at home. Locking yourself in the house is not a good way to deal with depression. Try to get out and find a place that can give you peace. Fresh air and exposure to sunlight will make the body feel fresher.
                      <br><br><span>- Meditation</span><br>
                      Meditation can provide a sensation of calm that can help to deal with stress and depression. Try to practice deep breathing and muscle relaxation while meditating.
                      <br><br><span>- Don't Forget to Laugh</span><br>
                      Depression will make you moodier, but don't let it go because it can make depression worse. Laugh because laughter can reduce brain tension that causes depression.
                      The amount of pressure you get from various aspects does make you easily depressed. Always keep your heart and mind calm in dealing with life's problems.
