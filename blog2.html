                    <p> Depression is a mood disorder that makes a person feel sad all the time. Depression is cited as a cause of death because sufferers tend to hurt themselves and even attempt suicide. To know more about this disease, let's discuss one by one the types of depression.
                        You need to know that depression consists of various kinds. Each type, is closely related to the underlying cause. More details, the following is an explanation of the types of depression, as quoted from the Cleveland Clinic website.
                      <br><br><span>- Major Depression</span><br>
                      This mood disorder has intense symptoms and lasts more than 2 weeks. Symptoms of depression that appear can interfere with daily life. Not only feeling sad, people with major depression also lose interest in things they like, have trouble sleeping, have trouble thinking, and change appetite. The exact cause of depression is not known. However, several factors can increase the risk, such as physical or chemical changes in the brain, hormonal changes, and a family history of similar diseases.
                      <br><br><span>- Bipolar Depression</span><br>
                      The next type of depression is that attacks people with bipolar disorder (bipolar disorder). A person with bipolar disorder, has three main episodes of which are the main symptoms, namely mania, hypomania, and depression. These three symptoms can appear alternately.
                      Symptoms of mania and hypomania are the opposite of depression. Mania and hypomania make people with bipolar disorder very eager to do many things, they can even act impulsively without thinking about the consequences.
                      Meanwhile, when experiencing a depressive episode, sufferers feel less energy, hopeless, and not interested in doing some activities.
                      Just like major depression, bipolar depression also has no known cause. However, some experts believe that changes in the brain and genetics may be factors that increase the risk.
                      <br><br><span>- Psychotic depression</span><br>
                      This type of depression causes symptoms of major depression followed by delusions or hallucinations. Delusions are beliefs in things that are not based on reality, whereas hallucinations lead to seeing, hearing, or feeling touched by things that don't really exist.
                      The causes of psychotic depression are not fully understood. However, most of the sufferers admit to having experienced stressful events. It can also be influenced by the medical history of family members with depression.                      
                      <br><br><span>- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</span><br>
                      Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that is associated with changing seasons. Most people with this condition experience symptoms from fall and continue for months into winter. This type of depression usually occurs in countries that have 4 seasons.
                      The symptoms are the same as major depression, only the time of appearance is typical in certain seasons.
                      The specific cause of depression is not known for certain. However, a disturbed biological clock, low levels of serotonin and melatonin can affect mood and sleep patterns, which can lead to depression.
                      <br><br><span>- Depression during pregnancy and postpartum depression</span><br>
                      Perinatal depression is a term for depression that occurs in pregnant women or after childbirth. Mothers with depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and fatigue that can make it difficult for them to perform daily tasks, including caring for themselves or their children.
                      This type of depression is different from the baby blues because depression causes symptoms for more than two weeks, while the baby blues usually go away in less than two weeks. When viewed from the symptoms, perinatal depression is much more severe than the baby blues.
                      Researchers show that depression after childbirth or during pregnancy is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Stress from the demands of the workplace, past trauma, the physical and emotional demands of delivering and caring for a baby, and the hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy can all contribute to the development of perinatal depression.
                      <br><br><span>- Dysthymia (Persistent depressive disorder)</span><br>
                      Another type of depression that a person may have is persistent disorder or dysthymia, which leads to long-term or chronic mood disorders.
                      The sufferer may lose interest in normal activities of daily living, feel hopeless, less productive, and have low self-esteem and an overall feeling of inadequacy. These symptoms last for years and can interfere with his relationships with family, school, work, and daily activities.
                      The cause is uncertain, some are even unknown. However, it is most likely related to brain conditions, family medical history, and traumatic events that have been experienced.
                      <br><br><span>- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</span><br>
                      Lastly, this type of depression only affects women and is similar to PMS (premenstrual syndrome), but with more serious symptoms. This depression causes severe irritability, depression, or anxiety in the week or two before your period starts. Symptoms usually go away two to three days after menstruation begins.
                      Researchers are unsure of the exact cause. However, some theories suggest that this condition has something to do with hormonal changes that occur before menstruation. Some women may be more sensitive to these changes, which can cause premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
